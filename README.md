# Ray Tracing

hi there! I have learned RayTracing from TheCherno videos and added OBJ file rendering functions.
i hope this will be more exiting.

### here is the original README:

A brand new educational YouTube series by Cherno. This repository contains all of the code for this project; most episodes will have their own commit you can browse.

## Building and running
Officially supports Windows 10/11 and Visual Studio 2022, with more platforms coming soon. You'll need to have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) installed.

1. Clone recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheCherno/RayTracing`
2. Run `scripts/Setup.bat`
3. Open `RayTracing.sln` and hit F5 (preferably change configuration to Release or Dist first, Debug is slow)
